Parameter types:

* craft_type - a string identifying a group of crafting recipes
* item_name - a string identifying a particular type of item, eg "default:stone"
* item_list - the product of an InvRef:get_list(listname) call
* count_list - a list of items and quantities in the form as used in this mod's recipe definitions
* listname - a string identifying a list within an inventory

simplecrafting_lib.register(craft_type, def)

example parameters:

"table", {
	input = {
		["group:stone"] = 1,
		["bucket:lava_bucket"] = 1,
	},
	output = {
		["default:obsidian"] = 2,
	},

	-- Items which the crafting recipe produces, but is not
	-- formally used to make.
	returns = {
		["bucket:bucket"] = 1,
	},
}

"furnace", {
	input = {
		["farming:flour"] = 1,
	},
	output = {
		["farming:bread"] = 1,
	},
	cooktime = 5.0,
}

"fuel", {
	input = {
		["group:tree"] = 1,
	},
	output = {
	},
	burntime = 40.0,
}

* The recipe def can have any other properties the user wishes to add, these examples only show the ones used by the crafting methods in this mod.

simplecrafting_lib.register_reversible(craft_type, forward_def)
* A convenience method that registers the provided crafting recipe and also automatically creates and registers a "reverse" craft of the same type.
* This should generally only be done with craft that turns one type of item into one other type of item (for example, metal ingots <-> metal blocks), but it will still work if there are multiple inputs.
* If there's more than one input type it will use "returns" to give them to the player in the reverse craft, using the input with the highest count as the primary output.
* Don't use a recipe that has a "group:" input with this, because obviously that can't be turned into an output. The mod will assert if you try to do this.

simplecrafting_lib.import_legacy_recipes()
* When run, this will cause recipes added via minetest.register_craft to be added to this crafting system.
* See simplecrafting_lib.register_recipe_import_filter(filter_function) for details on how to register a filter that will cause recipes to be imported

simplecrafting_lib.register_recipe_import_filter(filter_function)
* registers a filter function used by import_legacy_recipes. The filter function's signature must be of the form:
	function(legacy_method, recipe)
* legacy_method parameter will be either "normal", "cooking", or "fuel"
* recipe will be in the format described above for simplecrafting_lib.register. This method can modify the recipe parameter and those modifications will be reflected in the final registered version.
* returns two values: craft_type (string) and clear_recipe (bool). If craft_type is nil then the recipe won't be imported. If clear_recipe is true then the recipe will be removed from the native crafting system.

simplecrafting_lib.get_crafting_info(craft_type)
* returns a table with the members "recipe", "recipe_by_out" and "recipe_by_in" that contains all registered recipes for the craft type.
* Using this method will ensure that the craft_type's recipe tables will exist even if nothing's been registered for them yet.

simplecrafting_lib.is_fuel(craft_type, item_name)
* returns the fuel definition for the item if it is fuel, nil otherwise
* Group names are allowed in fuel definitions. If there is not an item specific recipe for the item_name provided here then it will take the definition of the longest burning group it belongs to.

simplecrafting_lib.get_fuels(craft_type, item_list, grade_definition)
* Returns a list of all fuel recipes whose ingredients can be satisfied by the item_list
* optional grade definition parameter of the form {min = minimum grade, max = maximum grade} to filter by grade

simplecrafting_lib.get_craftable_recipes(craft_type, item_list)
* Returns a list of all recipes whose ingredients can be satisfied by the item_list (as returned by InvRef:get_list(list_name))

simplecrafting_lib.get_craftable_items(craft_type, item_list, max_craftable, alphabetize)
* Returns a list of all the possible item stacks that could be crafted from the provided item list
* if max_craftable is true the returned stacks will have as many items in them as possible to craft, otherwise the returned stacks will have only the minimum output
* if alphabetize is true then the items will be sorted alphabetically by description, otherwise the items will be left in default order

simplecrafting_lib.is_possible_input(craft_type, item_name)
* Returns true if the item name is an input for at least one recipe belonging to the given craft type

simplecrafting_lib.is_possible_output(craft_type, item_name)
* Returns true if the item is a possible output for at least one recipe belonging to the given craft type

simplecrafting_lib.count_list_add(count_list1, count_list2)
* adds two count lists together, returns a new count list with the sum of the parameters' contents
* can be used for example to combine a recipe's "output" and "returns" to get a complete list of the recipe's products

simplecrafting_lib.add_items(inv, listname, count_list)
* Add the items in count_list to the inventory. Returns a count list containing the items that couldn't be added.

simplecrafting_lib.add_items_if_room(inv, listname, count_list)
* Attempts to add the items in count_list to the inventory. If it succeeds, returns true.
* If it fails, the inventory is not modified and returns false. (addition is atomic)

simplecrafting_lib.room_for_items(inv, listname, count_list)
* Returns true if there's room in the inventory to add all of the items in count_list, false otherwise.

simplecrafting_lib.remove_items(inv, listname, count_list)
* removes the items in the count_list (formatted as per recipe standards) from the inventory. Returns true on success, false on failure.
* Does not affect the inventory on failure (removal is atomic)

simplecrafting_lib.drop_items(pos, count_list)
* Drops the contents of a count_list at the given location in the world

simplecrafting_lib.get_crafting_result(crafting_type, item_list, request_stack)
* Returns a recipe with the inputs and outputs multiplied to match the requested quantity of ouput items in the crafted stack.
* Note that the output could actually be larger than request_stack if an exactly matching recipe can't be found.
* returns nil if crafting is impossible with the given source inventory

simplecrafting_lib.show_crafting_guide(craft_type, player)
* Displays a crafting guide to the player for the given craft_type
